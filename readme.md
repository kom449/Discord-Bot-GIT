# About this project
 This discord bot is made as a way for me to improve my coding skills, so beware that there might be bugs here and there. I try my best to keep it as bug free as possible. It started out as a simple idea of a bot to do fun commands such as sending a reponse when sending a command (first command ever made was the "bab" command) and then it evoled into a way bigger project than expected. i started spending way more time on the bot, as i learned new stuff and ways to do cool stuff. Latest entry to the list of stuff, is that the bot now requests from a API and stores the information in a DB, for it to use as a way to assign roles and remove them as needed. I'm always open for new ideas to the bot, so feel free to write a request in the issues tab, if there is something i should try adding to it.
 
 If you have any questions feel free to write to me on discord : Birdie Zukira#3950
