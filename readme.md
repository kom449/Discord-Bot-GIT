# To do list
 - Add commands to individual drinks
 - Automatic assign roles to users that have been kicked and reinvited
 - Optimize commands and put each command into individual files 
 
# Known Issues
 - Users can DM the bot with the commands, which should not be possible
 - There is currently no way to get specific roles of users
 
# Low priority
 - make embeds pretty
 - create global variables for the embeds, so it's easier to make them in the future
